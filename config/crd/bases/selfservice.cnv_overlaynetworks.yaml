              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  A comma-separated list of CIDRs and IP addresses.
                  IP addresses are removed from the assignable IP address pool and are never passed to the pods.

                  The maximum transmission unit (MTU).

                  Name is the overlay network identifier.
                  The actual overlay network is prefixed with the current namespace
                  to assure uniqueness across namespaces.
                type: string
              subnets:
                description: |-
                  The subnet to use for the network across the cluster.
                  Only include the CIDR for the node. E.g. 10.100.200.0/24.


                  IPv6 (2001:DBB::/64) and dual-stack (192.168.100.0/24,2001:DBB::/64) subnets are supported.


                  When omitted, the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication,
                  and users must configure IP addresses for the pods.
                  Port security only prevents MAC spoofing.
